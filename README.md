# Horiseon-Assessibility-Refactor
In this project I worked to make the Horiseon Search Engine website more assessible and refactored the code to make it easier to read for other coders. I changed the div's to semantic html. I added comments to the css to state their functions, and refactored code by getting rid of repetitivness.
